At the moment, I am Senior Data Scientist at National Health Service (NHS) in the UK.

**Research Interests:** My research focuses on the topic of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence, in particular, the statistical modelling and mathematical optimisation of several problems in Data Analytics and Decision Science.

In 2017, I defended my Ph.D. thesis on ‘Payoff Allocation Methods for Several Operational Research Games’. The project developed strategies and algorithms for finding fair & stable payoff allocations using Algorithmic Game Theory, Combinatorial Optimisation, Statistical Analysis. Several application areas of this work include Energy, Supply Chain Management, and Network Design.

Outside academia, I also had several projects with insurance firm (Ages UK), IT consultancy (IBM), and aviation (FDS Ltd - L3Harris Technology).  During freetime, I am leading the Data Science team of a non-profit organization to provide free world-class MOOC education (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) for Vietnamese children.
