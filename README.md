Welcome to my home page

At the moment, I am *Senior Data Scientist* at __National Health Service (NHS)__ in the UK. During my freetime, I *lead the Data Science team* of a non-profit organization to provide free world-class MOOC education (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) for Vietnamese children.

### Research Interests:
My research focuses on the topic of **Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence**, in particular, the statistical modelling and mathematical optimisation of several problems in Data Analytics and Decision Science.

In 2017, I defended my *Ph.D. thesis* on ‘**Payoff Allocation Methods for Several Operational Research Games**’. The project developed strategies and algorithms for finding fair & stable payoff allocations using *Algorithmic Game Theory, Combinatorial Optimisation, Statistical Analysis*. Several application areas of this work include *Energy, Supply Chain Management, and Network Design*.

Outside academia, I also had several projects with insurance firm (*Ages UK*), IT consultancy (*IBM*), and aviation (*FDS Ltd - L3Harris Technology*).
