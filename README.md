Currently, I am building a team to develop a healthtech product for elderly individuals who live alone or with senior partners. We're on a mission to tackle a challenge I'm deeply passionate about: enabling the elderly to age with independence through an AI companion that supports their health, home life, and social connection.

Here is my [*Linkedin page*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/phuochoangle/), go ahead to send me a message if you want to connect.

My previous work focuses on delivering the value of AI, Data Science, and Machine Learning to the areas of Healthcare, Education, and Industrial Applications.
Previously, I led the Data Science team of a non-profit organization [*STEAM for Vietnam*](https://steamforvietnam.org/) to provide __free world-class MOOC education__ (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) for Vietnamese children.

### Research Interests:
My research focuses on the topic of **Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence**, in particular, the statistical modelling and mathematical optimisation of several problems in Data Analytics and Decision Science.

In 2017, I defended my *Ph.D. thesis* in Economics on the topic of ‘**Payoff Allocation Methods for Several Operational Research Games**’. The project developed strategies and algorithms for finding fair & stable payoff allocations using *Algorithmic Game Theory, Combinatorial Optimisation, Statistical Analysis*. Several application areas of this work include *Energy, Supply Chain Management, and Network Design*.

After academia, I have worked and consulted for several projects in different industries such as medical device manufacturing (*CooperVision*), insurance (*Ages UK*), IT consultancy (*IBM*), and aviation (*FDS Ltd - L3Harris Technology*).
